### Note from reading dataset info:
Calculating final grades requires making some assumptions about assessment weights - weight of the assessment in %. Typically, Exams are treated separately and have the weight 100%; the sum of all other assessments is 100%.

B and J presentations should be analyzed separately as they may be different in stucture 

Nevertheless, for some presentations the corresponding previous B/J presentation do not exist and therefore the J presentation must be used to inform the B presentation or vice versa. In the dataset this is the case of CCC, EEE and GGG modules.
